        Batch requests take the form of a series of REST API requests. The overall result in the form of arrayed REST API responses is then returned to the client. This is useful for reducing HTTP overhead. The following conditions apply when using the batch endpoint:
          * The responses to the operations are returned in the same order as requested.
          * Only POST, PATCH and DELETE methods on /bids are supported.
          * The number of operations per batch is limited to 100.
          * Each operation is executed separately. The failure of one operation has no effect on the execution of the other operations in the batch or the processing of the overall batch. There is no transactionality across or dependency between single batch operations. E.g. one operation can fail and all following can still succeed!

              * `sequenceNumber` - An ascending number for the identification of different tender runs or time slices.

             For more details on the new tender id format, see the [reference guide.](/docs/guide#tender-id).
